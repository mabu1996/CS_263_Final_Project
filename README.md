# CS_263_Final_Project

This repo contains:
- A Jupyer notebook "Data Exploration" for exploration of the training data and a high-level overview of the encoder preprocessing and training procedure
- Jupyter notebooks "Single_Token_Prediction_Encoder" and "Multi_Token_Prediction_Encoder" that were run in Google Colab to obtain results for the Encoder-based approach to single-word and multi-word complexity predictions
- Jupyter notebooks "Single_Token_Prediction_ChatGPT" and "Multi_Token_Prediction_ChatGPT" that were run in Google Colab to obtain results for the ChatGPT-based approach to single-word and multi-word complexity predictions
- Training and test data (in ~/Data, these were uploaded to Colab when read into the corresponding notebooks)
- ChatGPT JSON logs for the 100 single-word and 100 multi-word test samples used for the ChatGPT component of the project (in ~/ChatGPT_logs, also uploaded to Colab for corresponding notebooks)
- PDFs of cited references (in ~/References)
